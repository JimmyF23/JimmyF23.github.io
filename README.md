My twine story is a representative character about the Mary Rose. The pilot, archer royal, and carpenter were the jobs that the user could learn more about. I implemented font change, color change, images, conditionals, and variables to make a more enjoyable experience for the user. After choosing a character, a passage is presented detailing what makes up a day in the life for their job on the Mary Rose. In that passage are links for the different tools that they use, for example brace and bits, mallets, and planes for the carpenter. These new passages detail what the tool is and what itâ€™s used for on the Mary Rose. My story gives a glimpse into life on the Mary Rose and provides in depth detail into those three characters.
